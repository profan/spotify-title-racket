spotify-title
---------------
does exactly the same thing as my thing written in perl6 did, except it's not written in perl6, because i couldn't be bothered reinstalling the thing, made for usage when streaming, reads title from spotify window and writes to file.

Usage
-----------

    # to write to file at ~/spotify-now-playing and loop continuously
    ./spotify-title --loop ~/spotify-now-playing
